# Pascal Analysis
This repo is designed to assist with typical batch analysis of PASCAL's characterization train. In addition, efforts are being made toward building out metrics that tie absorber level characterization to device. 

## Getting Started
Requires the frgpascal library in the PASCAL repo:
`pip install git+https://github.com/fenning-research-group/PASCAL.git`
